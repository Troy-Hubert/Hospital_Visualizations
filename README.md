# Hospital_Visualizations
### Background
This repo shows the code used to create visualizations for a data visualization and design course. 

### Purpose
The data for these visualizations came from a paritial hospitalization program (PHP) that treats psychiatric disorders. Data was collected for 8 years prior to analyses and visualizations. The aim of these visualziations is to elucidate information pertaining to patients seeking services from the hospital. This includes but is not limited to: who is coming to the hospital, how people progress through treatment, types of disorders treated, why people leave, and differences between duration of stay.
